# Assignment: Creating Django RESTful APIs - Group Project

## Assignment Overview:
In this group project, you will work in pairs to design, develop, and deploy Django RESTful APIs while adhering to best practices in API design, authentication, permissions, and documentation. Each group will have a unique scenario to work on, ensuring that the projects are diverse and tailored to different real-world situations. The projects will be submitted on GitHub Classroom, and participation will be evaluated based on GitHub contributions and the final deployed APIs.

## Project Requirements:

### 1. Scenario and Project Description:
Each group will be assigned a specific scenario that outlines the context and purpose of their API. The scenario should be chosen from the list provided below.

### 2. API Design and Development:
- Design the data models relevant to the scenario.
- Implement serializers to handle data validation and conversion.
- Create RESTful endpoints that fulfill the requirements of the scenario.
- Implement JWT-based authentication and permissions for secure access.

### 3. Advanced API Techniques:
- Implement rate limiting and throttling to control API usage.
- Integrate API documentation using Swagger for clear API understanding.

### 4. API Deployment:
- [Deploy the API on a cloud platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Azure, Railway)](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-hosting-deployment-options).
- Ensure the deployed API is accessible and functional.

## Scenario Options (At least 2 groups will be assigned one scenario):

1. **E-Commerce Platform API:**
   Build a RESTful API for an e-commerce platform. Include endpoints for browsing products, adding products to the cart, and processing orders.

2. **Social Media API:**
   Create a RESTful API for a social media platform. Implement endpoints for user profiles, posts, comments, and likes.

3. **Online Learning API:**
   Develop an API for an online learning platform. Include endpoints for courses, lessons, student progress, and achievements.

4. **Weather Data API:**
   Build a RESTful API for accessing weather data. Implement endpoints to retrieve weather forecasts for different locations.

5. **Travel Booking API:**
   Create an API for a travel booking platform. Include endpoints for searching and booking flights, hotels, and rental cars.

6. **Health and Fitness API:**
   Develop a RESTful API for a health and fitness application. Implement endpoints for tracking workouts, setting goals, and monitoring progress.

7. **Music Streaming API:**
   Build an API for a music streaming service. Include endpoints for browsing songs, creating playlists, and managing user preferences.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Groups will be evaluated based on the following aspects:
- Ideation & Extension of the scenario
- Code quality and adherence to best practices
- Functional and properly documented endpoints
- Effective use of serializers and authentication mechanisms
- Implementation of advanced API techniques (rate limiting, throttling)
- Clear and concise API documentation using Swagger
- Successful deployment of the API on a cloud platform
- GitHub contributions and version control usage

## Submission:
Each group's GitHub repository for their project  will be automatically created upon accepting the assignment invite and commits & push will trigger submission for evaluation when deadline is reached.

This assignment aims to provide you with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying real-world Django RESTful APIs.
## NOTE:
Don't forget to include:
- your registration numbers on the read me file
- url of the deployed API
Good luck, and Happy coding on your API projects!
